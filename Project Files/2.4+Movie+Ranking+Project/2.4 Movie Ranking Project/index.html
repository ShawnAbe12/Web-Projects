<h1>The Best Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>MY top 3 favorite movies </h2>

<hr />

<h3>#3: Avengers Endgame </h3>
<p> The buildup to this movie was insane. With the last movie ending with the good guys losing the audience had 
    absolutely no idea what was going to happen in this one. This was the movie that marked the downfall for marvel</p>

<h3>#2: Spiderman: Across the Spiderverse</h3>
<p> This Movie was amazing. There was so much hype leading up to this movie and I loved every second of it until the ending.
    The cliffhanger was awful to see in theaters. Also The new one aint even coming out anytime soon because of all the drama surrounding it</p>

<h3>#1: Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse</h3>
<p>This is what all movies should aspire to be like. Lovabale for all audiences and just a general all time classic.
    I personally love the What's Up danger scene so much that I had it replaying every day after I watched the movie</p>
